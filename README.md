DeviceRestService
=================

Newest Device Rest Server. This is a java server to build a library for restful interfaces to make hardware models. It is a collaboration of multiple people including Frank, Adam, Pobzeb, and myself just hosted on my account for now. It requires DeviceModel, gson-2.2.4.jar and jdom2-2.0.5.jar to run.
